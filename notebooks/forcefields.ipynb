    "\n",
    "OpenFF's force fields use the The SMIRks Native Open Force Field (SMIRNOFF) [specification](https://openforcefield.github.io/standards/standards/smirnoff/) and are conventionally encoded in `.offxml` files. The spec fully describes the contents of a SMIRNOFF force field, how parameters should be applied, and several other important usage details. You could implement a SMIRNOFF engine in your own code, but conveniently the OpenFF Toolkit already provides this and a handful of utilities. Let's load up OpenFF 2.1.0 (code name \"Sage\") and inspect its contents!"

    "### smirnoff99Frosst\n",
    "\n",
    "This [force field](https://github.com/openforcefield/smirnoff99Frosst) is mostly a historical artifact today. It is the first SMIRNOFF force field, dating back to 2016. It is based on Merck-Frosst's [parm@frosst](http://www.ccl.net/cca/data/parm_at_Frosst/) and an old AMBER force field, parm99, which predates GAFF.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not recommended for general use today, but you might see it in papers that compare the performance of different force fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parsley\n",
    "\n",
    "The Parsley line of force fields (`openff-1.y.z.offxml`) was OpenFF's [first full force field release](https://openforcefield.org/community/news/general/introducing-openforcefield-1.0/). Based on `smirnoff99Frosst`, these force fields are primarily re-fits of valence parameters using a large number of QM structures pulled from QCArchive. The first version was 1.0.0 and subsequent re-fits produced versions 1.1.0, 1.2.0, and 1.3.0. More detail is provided in an [associated paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.1c00571).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sage\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sage line of force fields (`openff-2.y.z.offxml`) continued the process of fitting to more (and more diverse) QM datasets, but also included a re-fit of the Lennard-Jones parameters. Small molecule geometries and energies [improved, in general,](https://openforcefield.org/community/news/general/sage2.0.0-release/) significantly over Parsley. These improvements notably transferred to protein-ligand binding free energies despite Sage not being specifically fit to them. For more, see the [associated paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.3c00039).\n",
    "\n",
    "A subsequent [2.1.0 release](https://openforcefield.org/community/news/general/sage2.1.0-release/) used different fitting procedures to further improve small molecule performance. Some issues with sulfonamides and a few other specific chemistries were also addressed. **Sage 2.1.0 (`openff-2.1.0.offxml`) is the recommended force field for small molecule studies.**\n",

    "- TIP3P-FB\n",
    "- TIP4P-FB\n",
    "- OPC\n",
    "- OPC3\n",
    "\n",
    "Existing main-line OpenFF force fields are fit against TIP3P water, so use of others is not (currently) recommended. This might change in the future, or OpenFF might even fit a new water model in a future release.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ff14SB\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenFF, in collaboration with Dave Cerutti of the Amber community, created a port of [ff14SB](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00255), a popular Amber protein force field. There are some small numberical differences with how improper torsions are evaluated, but all other terms reproduce a canonical Amber source to high accuracy. **This is the only protein force field currently in SMIRONOFF (`.offxml`) format** and therefore the current recommendation for use with proteins. Primarily for technical reasons, porting other Amber force fields is not planned.\n",

    "### Rosemary\n",
    "A future line of force fields from OpenFF (code name \"Rosemary\", starting with `openff-3.0.0.offxml`) is intended to handle small molecules and biopolymers in a _self-consistent_ manner. The first release is expected to handle proteins, but future versions (likely 2025 and beyond) may cover nucleic acids. The performance, depending on the metrics used, is hoped to be comparable with existing Amber-family protein force fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no specific release date planned for Rosemary, but it may be available in late 2023 or early 2024. (A beta release candidate may also be publically available prior to the full release.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graph net charge assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Another release, possibly in the Rosemary line, is intended to include graph-convolutional neutral network (GCNN)-based charge assignment using [NAGL](https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-nagl). Details are still being worked out, but it is expected to approximately reproduce AM1-BCC (or some variant) without the typical $O(N^3)$ scaling, making it suitable for large (>> 100 atoms) molecules).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Virtual sites\n",
    "\n",
    "Another release from OpenFF may include some virtual site parameters with off-center charges. No release date is planned, but the most of the supporting infrastructure is currently in place and some early studies have shown promise for better representing electrostatics of chemistries such as halogens and aromatic nitrogens.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## From you!\n",
    "\n",
    "Anybody can write a SMIRNOFF force field! This workshop doesn't have time to cover force field _fitting_, but there are plenty of freely-available tools used today that can re-fit existing force fields or generate something new from the ground up. Once you've fit a new force field, a small Python package can distribute it in a way that the toolkit can [automatically load](https://docs.openforcefield.org/projects/toolkit/en/stable/faq.html#how-can-i-distribute-my-own-force-fields-in-smirnoff-format)!"
