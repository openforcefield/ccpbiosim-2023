    "# SMIRNOFF Force Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenFF's force fields use the The SMIRks Native Open Force Field (SMIRNOFF) [specification](https://openforcefield.github.io/standards/standards/smirnoff/) and are conventionally encoded in `.offxml` files. The spec fully describes the contents of a SMIRNOFF force field, how parameters should be applied, and several other important usage details. You could implement a SMIRNOFF engine in your own code, but conveniently the OpenFF Toolkit already provides this and a handful of utilities. Let's load up OpenFF 2.1.0 (code name \"Sage\") and inspect its contents!"

    "\n",
    "This [force field](https://github.com/openforcefield/smirnoff99Frosst) is mostly a historical artifact today. It is the first SMIRNOFF force field, dating back to 2016. It is based on Merck-Frosst's [parm@frosst](http://www.ccl.net/cca/data/parm_at_Frosst/) and an old AMBER force field, parm99, which predates GAFF.\n",

    "The Parsley line of force fields (`openff-1.y.z.offxml`) was OpenFF's [first full force field release](https://openforcefield.org/community/news/general/introducing-openforcefield-1.0/). Based on `smirnoff99Frosst`, these force fields are primarily re-fits of valence parameters using a large number of QM structures pulled from QCArchive. The first version was 1.0.0 and subsequent re-fits produced versions 1.1.0, 1.2.0, and 1.3.0. More detail is provided in an [associated paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.1c00571).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sage\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sage line of force fields (`openff-2.y.z.offxml`) continued the process of fitting to more (and more diverse) QM datasets, but also included a re-fit of the Lennard-Jones parameters. Small molecule geometries and energies [improved, in general,](https://openforcefield.org/community/news/general/sage2.0.0-release/) significantly over Parsley. These improvements notably transferred to protein-ligand binding free energies despite Sage not being specifically fit to them. For more, see the [associated paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.3c00039).\n",
    "\n",
    "A subsequent [2.1.0 release](https://openforcefield.org/community/news/general/sage2.1.0-release/) used different fitting procedures to further improve small molecule performance. Some issues with sulfonamides and a few other specific chemistries were also addressed. **Sage 2.1.0 (`openff-2.1.0.offxml`) is the recommended force field for small molecule studies.**\n",

There are some small numberical differences with how improper torsions are evaluated, but all other terms reproduce a canonical Amber source to high accuracy. **This is the only protein force field currently in SMIRONOFF (`.offxml`) format** and therefore the current recommendation for use with proteins. Primarily for technical reasons, porting other Amber force fields is not planned.\n",

No release date is planned, but the most of the supporting infrastructure is currently in place and some early studies have shown promise for better representing electrostatics of chemistries such as halogens and aromatic nitrogens.\n",

    "Anybody can write a SMIRNOFF force field! This workshop doesn't have time to cover force field _fitting_, but there are plenty of freely-available tools used today that can re-fit existing force fields or generate something new from the ground up. Once you've fit a new force field, a small Python package can distribute it in a way that the toolkit can [automatically load](https://docs.openforcefield.org/projects/toolkit/en/stable/faq.html#how-can-i-distribute-my-own-force-fields-in-smirnoff-format)!"
