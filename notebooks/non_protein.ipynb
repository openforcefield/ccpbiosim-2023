In fact, our force fields are trained to small molecule physical properties - for example part of the training of Sage was making sure it could reproduce experimental densities of organic mixtures. To show the versatility of our force fields, the following example will simulate [a \"host-guest\" system from the SAMPL6 challenge](https://github.com/samplchallenges/SAMPL6/tree/master/host_guest).
