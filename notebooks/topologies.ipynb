    "PDB files are a common way to represent biopolymer structures, but they don't contain all of the chemical information that we need to parameterize a molecule in OpenFF (they're missing bond orders and formal charges, so those must be determined by cross-referncing against the known chemistry of amino acids and other building blocks). PDB files are used widely in the molecular simulation community for legacy reasons, so OpenFF has implemented functionality to load them.\n",

    "The best way to load PDB files for use with OpenFF is using the [`Topology.from_pdb` method](https://docs.openforcefield.org/projects/toolkit/en/stable/api/generated/openff.toolkit.topology.Topology.html#openff.toolkit.topology.Topology.from_pdb). Lots of file names end in `.pdb` but not all of them are loadable by the OpenFF Toolkit. Specifically, we require the loaded PDBs to have a few things:\n",

    "* All hydrogens must be explicit\n",
    "\n",
    "For small molecules, waters, and ions:\n",
    "* The element of each atom must be identified in the final column of the file\n",
