# Outline

## Main session

* Preview/show off a "simple" top-to-bottom example, without going into the details
* Dealing with units
  * [notebook](https://github.com/openforcefield/interchange-workshop-2022/blob/main/notebooks/units.ipynb)
* Loading small molecules
  * Molecule cookbook
* Working with topologies
  * OpenMM interoperability
* Loading proteins/biopolymers
  * There should be a "cookbook" for this
* Chemical perception
* Loading force fields
  * Briefly walk through an OFFXML file
  * Briefly describe each "recommended" force field
* Creating, exploring Interchange objects
* Preparing protein-ligand systems
  * Load protein/ligand/force field
  * Solvating/box-packing
  * Running single-point energies or simulations in OpenMM, GROMACS, Amber

## (extra) Other topics within OpenFF

* NAGL for assign charges on polymers, medium-sized molecules
* What to expect with Rosemary
* Vectorized representations
* ParameterHandler plugins
* Modifying force fields
* Virtual sites

## (extra) Other topics with adjacent tools

* PDBFixer (PDB files and water packing)
* More PACKMOL?
